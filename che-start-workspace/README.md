# Openshift.io Auth Services Performance Evaluation
These tests are intended to measure performance of the REST endpoints of the OSIO Auth Services
as well as the user experience such as login from the OSIO UI.

## Environment
The tested server is the OSIO [Auth Services deployed in prod-preview](https://auth.prod-preview.openshift.io/api/status).
The clients to the tested server are deployed on the client nodes 
of the [OsioPerf Lab](https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth-tests/blob/master/performance/README.md).

## Test setup
The test in the environment is executed with 10 tested OSIO user accounts that has a GitHub account linked.
The user accounts are evenly spread between 10 individual client nodes of the OsioPerf Lab
from whose the requests are sent via 100 simultaneous clients (=simulated users). Each simulated user waits randomly between 1 to 10 seconds
before sending another request.

The whole performance test suite is executed regularly once per hour
while a single run takes a login phase + 5 minutes of load phase (see below). The summary results of each run
are uploaded to the [Zabbix](https://zabbix.devshift.net:9443/zabbix/screens.php?elementid=32&fullscreen=1) monitoring system
to track the results' history. 

## Scenarios
The performance test suite is divided into two phases of testing:
 * *Prepare* - where each test user is logged in via UI once, while times to certain checkpoints are measured.
 * *Load* - where requests are sent to the tested endpoints repeatedly, while the response time is measured. 

### Prepare phase
Executed once per user to get userâ€™s tokens, ID and name before the load test begins.
This is necessary to obtain access tokens for the requests to the secured endpoints.

#### OAuth2 Friendly Login
##### *Open login page* (`oauth2-open-login-page-time`)
From 
```
GET /api/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=740650a2-9c44-4db5-b067-a3d1b2cd2d01&scope=user:email&state=<STATE>&redirect_uri=https://<AUTH_SERVER_HOST>/api/status
```
where `state` is generated unique UUID v4 wait for the `LOG IN` button to be clickable which indicates that the page is loaded. (in `/login` it is upto us to generate `state`, thus we use uuid, but in `/authorize` state is generated and sent by client, we don't have a restriction on that. `state` sent by client could be any string, but since state is supposed to be random enough and unique, uuid would be a good choice. But it is upto client to use it or not)

##### *Get code* (`oauth2-get-code-time`)
From clicking on the `LOG IN` button wait to be redirected to the `https://<AUTH_SERVER_HOST>/api/status?code=<CODE>&state=<STATE>`.

Check that the returned `<STATE>` is equal to the original and extract `<CODE>` from the URI.

##### *Get token* (`oauth2-get-token-time`)
Using HTTP client send:
```
POST /api/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	
grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=740650a2-9c44-4db5-b067-a3d1b2cd2d01&code=<CODE>&redirect_uri=https://<AUTH_SERVER_HOST>/api/status
```

From the response JSON extract the `auth_token` and `refresh_token`.

##### *Login the user* (`oauth2-login-time`)
This is computed as a sum of `oauth2-get-code-time` and `oauth2-get-token-time` values.

### Load phase
TODO: describe metrics


## How to run the tests locally
By default the load test executed by Locust tool runs in a distributed mode, i.e. uses remote access
to the Master and Slave nodes via SSH to start Locust process on those nodes to load the tested system
from a different places.

However, it is possible to switch the test to the local execution. To do that simply set the environment
variable `RUN_LOCALLY=true`. The easiest way is to uncomment the respective line in `_setenv.sh` file.

To run the test, configure the test in `_setenv.sh` file and run the `run.sh` script.
